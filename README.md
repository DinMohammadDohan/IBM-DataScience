Project Name: SpaceX Launch Prediction. The data for this project was gathered by web scraping with BeautifulSoup and the SpaceX API to
obtain information about the Falcon 9 launch wiki page. analytics were then carried out. Several
models were subjected to a predictive analysis in order to determine "whether a landing would be
successful or not" and the model that performed the best overall was selected.

Result: From 2010 to 2019, 61 missions had successful landing whereas 10 missions had failure
landing, leading a success rate of 67.78%. Logistic Regression and Decision Tree performed well in
comparison with other models, with the highest accuracy of 83.3%
